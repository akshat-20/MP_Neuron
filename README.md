# MP_Neuron

This repository contains the implementation of mp neuron model.

McCulloch (neuroscientist) and Pitts (logician) proposed a highly simplified computational model of the neuron in 1943. MP neuron model is also known as linear threshold gate model.

### Mathematical model

where:  g aggregates the inputs and the function f takes a decision based on this aggregation

b is called the thresholding parameter. This is called Thresholding Logic
